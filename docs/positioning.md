# NRR Positioning: Ambiguity-Preserving Inference vs Nearby Methods

NRR targets **ambiguity-preserving inference** for practical LLM systems. The main risk addressed is **premature commitment in LLM decoding** and downstream rework from **semantic collapse**. NRR controls **defer vs commit** timing under explicit conditions rather than forcing universal abstention or universal commitment.

## NRR vs Nearby Concepts (What It Solves / Does Not Solve)

| Approach | What it solves | What it does not solve | Difference from NRR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fuzzy reasoning | Represents graded truth or soft category boundaries. | Does not directly manage multiple discrete interpretations across multi-turn LLM inference. | NRR keeps competing interpretations as state candidates and delays commitment by policy. |
| Calibrated abstention | Decides whether to answer or abstain when confidence is low. | Does not preserve internal contradictory interpretations for later reuse. | NRR preserves alternatives internally, then chooses defer/commit at output boundaries. |
| WSD (word sense disambiguation) | Selects one word sense from local context. | Does not target global ambiguity persistence under context shifts. | NRR treats unresolved multiplicity as valid state, not only as an error to eliminate. |

## Boundary Conditions

- NRR is not anti-LLM and does not replace standard LLM use.
- NRR is evaluated as conditional utility under specific tasks and protocols.
- This page is for positioning; formal definitions remain in manuscript and reproducibility docs.
